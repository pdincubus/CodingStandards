## Introduction

This CSS Standard is based upon a combination of (and in some cases stolen verbatim from) many other great styleguides, including:

* http://codeguide.co/#css
* https://github.com/sky-uk/css
* https://github.com/necolas/idiomatic-css
* https://github.com/airbnb/css
* https://github.com/dropbox/css-style-guide

<a name="stylelint"></a>
## Stylelint

We use [Stylelint](https://stylelint.io/) to help spot many issues. This is part of our build and compilation process using Gulp.

<a name="terminology"></a>
## Terminology

<a name="rule-declaration"></a>
### Rule declaration

A "rule declaration" is the name given to a selector (or a group of selectors) with an accompanying group of properties:

```css
.listing {
    font-size: 18px;
    line-height: 1.2;
}
```

<a name="selectors"></a>
### Selectors

In a rule declaration, "selectors" are the bits that determine which elements in the DOM tree will be styled by the defined properties. Selectors can match HTML elements, as well as an element's class, ID, or any of its attributes:

```css
.my-element-class {
    /* ... */
}

[aria-hidden] {
    /* ... */
}
```

<a name="properties"></a>
### Properties

Finally, properties are what give the selected elements of a rule declaration their style. Properties are key-value pairs, and a rule declaration can contain one or more property declarations:

```css
/* some selector */ {
    background: #f1f1f1;
    color: #333;
}
```

<a name="syntax-and-basics"></a>
## Syntax and basics

* Use soft tabs with 4 spaces. If you open a file that has hard tabs, convert them
* Individual selectors should have their own line
* Each declaration should be on its own line
* Put a space before opening curly braces
* Closing braces should be on their own line
* Put a space after a colon `:` but not before
* All declarations should end with a semicolon `;`
* Comma-separated values should have a space after each comma, except
* Within colour or shape declarations such as `rgb()`, `rgba()`, `hsl()`, `hsla()`, `rect()`, `clip()`, where there should be no space after each comma
* Do not prefix property values or colour parameters with a leading zero
* Where allowed, avoid specifying units for zero values, e.g. `margin: 0` instead of `margin: 0px`
* All hex colour values should be lowercase
* Use shorthand hex values where possible
* Do not user colour names
* Quote values in selectors, e.g. `input[type='text']`
* Use single quotes where a quote is required
* Do not quote strings in a `url()`, e.g. for a `background-image` or a `font-face` src.
* All colours except black (`#000`) and white (`#fff`) should be stored in variables to avoid colour palette madness
* Do not add blank lines between declarations
* Do not set all values for a property when not required, e.g. set `margin-bottom: 10px` instead of `margin: 0 0 10px 0`
* Do not add vendor-prefixed declarations to source stylesheets, unless it is something [Autoprefixer](https://github.com/postcss/autoprefixer) cannot account for
* Ensure [declaration order](#declaration-order) standards are followed
* Do not leave more than 1 empty line outside of rule sets
* Ensure 1 blank line separates rulesets
* Leave an empty line at the end of a file
* Do not use ID selectors
* Do not unnecessarily nest selectors
* Do use basic namespacing for utility classes, e.g. `.u-vh` for the visually hidden screen reader helper class
* Never directly overwrite a previously defined class
* Use `border: 0` instead of `border: none` to specify that a style has no border
* CSS or SCSS variables should be lowecase and hyphenated
* Do not use HTML tags in CSS selectors. e.g. `.modal {}` and not `div.modal {}`
* Do *not* _ever_ use `!important`
* Do not use margin-top. Vertical margins collapse. Always prefer padding-top or margin-bottom on preceding elements
* Ensure you trim excess whitespace from the document. Your editor can probably be configured to do this automatically on save
* Pseudo-elements should use double colon notation, e.g. `::before` not `:before`
* Avoid writing styles that will be immediately overridden at a breakpoint change. Only add styles outside an `@media` query that are global to that selector
* Use numerical instead of named settings where possible, e.g. `background-position: 0 0;` instead of `background-position: top left;`

Bad example:

```css
    .aBadThing, .a_bad-thing{
        color:red
      background-color:#FFFFFF;

        margin: 0px 0 0 0px;}
```

Good example:

```css
    .a-good-thing,
    .a-good_thing {
        color: var(--red);
        background-color: #fff;
        margin: 0;
    }
```

<a name="declaration-order"></a>
## Declaration order

Related property declarations should be grouped together following the order:

1. Structure/positioning/box-model - `display`, `position`, `margin`, `padding`, `width`, `height`, `box-sizing`, `overflow` etc.
2. Most other styles:
    * Typography - `font-*`, `line-height`, `text-*`, `letter-spacing` etc.
    * Cosmetic - `color`, `background-*`, `border-*`, `animation`, `transition` etc.
    * Native interaction - `appearance`, `cursor`, `user-select`, `pointer-events` etc.
3. Pseudo-elements - `::before`, `::after` etc.
4. Pseudo-classes - `:hover`, `:focus`, `:active` etc.
5. `@media` - media queries should be defined last for ease of modification and readability.

Positioning comes first because it can remove an element from the normal flow of the document and override box model related styles. The box model comes next as it dictates a component's dimensions and placement.

There's a [CSS Comb](.csscomb.json) config for this, and you can install a plugin for your favourite editor.

<a name="media-query-placement"></a>
## Media query placement

* Place media queries as close to their relevant rule sets whenever possible.
* Do not bundle them all in a separate stylesheet or at the end of the document

<a name="single-declarations"></a>
## Single declarations

In instances where a rule set includes only one declaration, consider removing line breaks for readability and faster editing. Any rule set with multiple declarations should be split to separate lines.

The key factor here is error detection - e.g., a CSS validator stating you have a syntax error on Line 183. With a single declaration, there's no missing it. With multiple declarations, separate lines is a must for your sanity.

<a name="shorthand-notation"></a>
## Shorthand notation

Strive to limit use of shorthand declarations to instances where you must explicitly set all the available values. Common overused shorthand properties include:

* padding
* margin
* font
* background
* border
* border-radius

Often we don't need to set all the values a shorthand property represents. For example, HTML headings only set top and bottom margin, so when necessary, only override those two values. Excessive use of shorthand properties often leads to sloppier code with unnecessary overrides and unintended side effects.

<a name="nesting"></a>
## Nesting

Avoid unnecessary nesting. Just because you can nest, doesn't mean you always should. Consider nesting only if you must scope styles to a parent and if there are multiple elements to be nested. If you must nest selectors, do not go more than three levels deep.

If you're using Sublime Text, you can set your ruler guides to help you spot this easily:

```
"rulers":
[
    0,
    12,
    80
],
```

<a name="operators"></a>
## Operators

For improved readability, wrap all mathematical operations in parentheses with a single space between values, variables, and operators.

<a name="comments"></a>
## Comments

Code is written and maintained by people. Ensure your code is descriptive, well commented, and approachable by others. Great code comments convey context or purpose. Do not simply reiterate a component or class name.

* Place comments on a new line above their subject
* Keep line-length to a sensible maximum, e.g., 80 columns
* Make liberal use of comments to break CSS code into discrete sections
* Be sure to write in complete sentences for larger comments and succinct phrases for general notes

<a name="class-names-and-naming"></a>
## Class names and naming

* Keep classes lowercase
* Keep classes as short and succinct as possible
* Use meaningful names; use structural or purposeful names over presentational
* Use `.js-*` classes to denote behavior (as opposed to style), but keep these classes out of your CSS
* `.is_`, `.has_` for stateful classes. Use these classes for temporary, optional, or short-lived states and styles

We use a combination of BEM, ITCSS and a dash of Common Senseâ„¢ for class naming. This allows the following benefits:

* It helps create clear, strict relationships between CSS and HTML
* It helps us create reusable components
* It allows for less nesting and lower specificity
* It helps in building scalable stylesheets

It's a similar convention to the BEM alternative ['Two Dashes'](https://en.bem.info/methodology/naming-convention/#two-dashes-style) style.

Namespace - Block - Element - Modifier

`.namespace-` + `block-name` + `__elem-name` + `--modifier-name` === `.mysite-modal__title--alt`.

If you require further specificity, for example if you're working on Account Change or Member Centre, you can add an additional namespace after `pn`, e.g:

`.mysite-block-name__elem-name--modifier-name` or `.mysite-block-name__elem-name--modifier-name`

An example:

```css
    .mysite-modal {
        /* Styles that do not change across breakpoints */

        &--large {
            /* Modifier styles that do not change across breakpoints */
        }

        @media (--desktop) {
            /* Styles just for this breakpoint */

            &--large {
                /* Modifier styles just for this breakpoint */
            }
        }

        @media (--tablet) {
            /* Styles just for this breakpoint */
        }

        @media (--mobile) {
            /* Styles just for this breakpoint */
        }
    }

    .mysite-modal__title {
        /* Styles that do not change across breakpoints */

        @media (--desktop) {
            /* Styles just for this breakpoint */
        }

        @media (--tablet) {
            /* Styles just for this breakpoint */
        }

        @media (--mobile) {
            /* Styles just for this breakpoint */
        }
    }

    .mysite-modal__content {
        /* Styles that do not change across breakpoints */

        @media (--desktop) {
            /* Styles just for this breakpoint */
        }

        @media (--tablet) {
            /* Styles just for this breakpoint */
        }

        @media (--mobile) {
            /* Styles just for this breakpoint */
        }
    }

    .mysite-modal__link {
        /* Styles that do not change across breakpoints */

        &:hover,
        &:focus {
            /* State styles that do not change across breakpoints */
        }

        @media (--desktop) {
            /* Styles just for this breakpoint */

            &:hover,
            &:focus {
                /* State style just for this breakpoint */
            }
        }

        @media (--tablet) {
            /* Styles just for this breakpoint */
        }

        @media (--mobile) {
            /* Styles just for this breakpoint */
        }
    }
```

<a name="organisation"></a>
## Organisation

* Organize sections of code by component, and split components into partials

<a name="dont-use-import"></a>
## Don't use @import

Compared to `<link>`, @import is slower, adds extra page requests, and can cause other unforeseen problems. Avoid them.
